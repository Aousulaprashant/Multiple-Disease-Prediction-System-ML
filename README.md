## 📌 About the Project  
Prashanth’s IntelliHealth Predictor is an **AI-powered disease prediction system** that helps users assess their health risks based on medical parameters.  
This system uses **Machine Learning (ML)** to predict the likelihood of:  

✅ **Diabetes**  
✅ **Heart Disease**  
✅ **Parkinson’s Disease**  

With an easy-to-use **Streamlit interface**, users can input their details and get instant predictions backed by **trained ML models**.  

## 📂 Dataset & Model Building  
The models are trained on medical datasets using **Scikit-Learn** algorithms.  
For detailed steps on **data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training**, check [`model_building.md`](model_building.md).
